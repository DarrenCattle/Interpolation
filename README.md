Interpolation
=============

Interpolation is a simple script to make smooth curves from scattered datapoints.
Future implementations may involve non linear curves that take from the whole dataset.
This is currently under use for some diagramming at University of Texas at Austin.
The input file can be renamed in the first line and please specify the number of lines in the program for efficiency.
For now the input is pretty specific: hour:minute \t variable
but if other uses are requested it can be programmed.
Thank you and I am making simple programs for daily use.
